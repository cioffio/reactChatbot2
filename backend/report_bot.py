Column 1 entries = [Full legal name, Legal form, Registered address, Principal business address (may be the same as registered address), Business description (SIC codes), Name of key executives, Registration authority, Registration number, Registration date, Registration status, Regulator (only for financial institutions), Identification of UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner), Source of Funds]Â 
Column 2 name = Data_point. Column 2 entries = The corresponding value of Data_point_name, found using the below data or source of funds.
Column 3 name = Data_source. Column 3 entries = Source of the data, if a data point was provided.
Column 4 name = Date_sourced
Format the table as csv. Enclose each entry x with " as "x". Only use data provided in this prompt, do not use data from the internet which you have not been directly provided.
Where a given entry has multiple parts, separate them with commas instead of quotation marks.
Do not return any duplicates within column 1.
